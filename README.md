📌 Project Description (Very Clear & Simple)

This Landing Page is a single-page design created to highlight a product, service, or brand.
It focuses on clean layout, readability, and smooth structure.

The page includes:

Hero Section – A main heading, subtitle, and call-to-action button

About / Info Section – Brief details about the product or service

Features Section – Highlights of what is being offered

Footer – Simple ending section with basic info


The complete page is fully responsive, meaning it adjusts properly on:

✔ Mobile
✔ Tablet
✔ Desktop

This project helped me understand how to build real-world landing pages with proper structure and styling.
